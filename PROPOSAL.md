For my final project, I plan to implement a canvas on which the user paints an incomplete picture and the program 
predicts the colors of the empty pixels. I will code neural networks from scratch that use the colored 
pixels as training and test data and then guess the colors of the other pixels given the x and y locations.

I have experience with neural networks and a very solid understanding of the mathematics behind the basic neural 
network, so I think that implementing the networks will be manageable with enough time. A potential problem is 
the small amount of training data, which will limit the neural network's accuracy. However, I really love neural 
networks, and I would like to apply them to artwork and explore the results.

In the first week, I plan to generate training data examples, write the structure of the network objects, and implement 
the forward feed. In the second week, I plan to implement backpropagation so that the network can learn to predict pixel
colors given x and y coordinates. In the third week, I plan to write the Cinder application to include a canvas and 
paintbrush for the user and controls to fill in the incomplete picture. 

If I finish early, some stretch goals would be implementing other methods to predict pixel colors and compare the 
results with the neural network. Possible methods are linear regression, k-means clustering, and examining surrounding 
pixels.
